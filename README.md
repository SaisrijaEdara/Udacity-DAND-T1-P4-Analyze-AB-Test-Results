# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree - Term 1 - Project 4: Analyze A/B Test Results

## Introduction

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these.

## Project Scope:
For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an **e-commerce website**. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

All of the items on the [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/37e27304-ad47-4eb0-a1ab-8c12f60e43d0/rubric) must meet specifications to successfully complete the project.
